# Contributing to php-kafka-consumer

We welcome all kinds of contributions. If you intend on becoming part of our
community, please keep the following points in mind.

## Conduct

In general, be good to each other and leave the world a better place than it was
before your contribution.

## Issues and discussions

We use Github to track bugs, feature requests, and other discussions.

Please be clear when reporting a bug and add all relevant information.
Maintainers may request additional info as necessary.

You are encouraged to take part in all discussions about new features and
improvements.

## Code and documentation

When submitting a contribution, please fork the project and make a pull request
against the master branch. Make sure all tests are passing and add relevant
tests as necessary. A maintainer will review your contributions and make a new
release as necessary.

If your contributions address a complex issue, it might be a good idea to
discuss it first, please make sure an issue is open and the community is settled
on a solution. Pull requests may be denied if the maintainers are not sure that
the changes address a real problem in the best way possible.
